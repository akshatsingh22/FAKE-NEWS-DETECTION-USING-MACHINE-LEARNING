# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
The Dataset used for this work was pretty small 28000k rows approximately.
It has pre-indicated true and fake headlines where is_sarcastic == 0 states true headlines and is_sarcastic == 1 indicates fake headlines.
The file format was JSON.
To implement this I followed Datacamp sklearn tutorials.
